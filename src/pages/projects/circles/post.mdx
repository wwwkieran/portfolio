long_description: "How can artists use neural networks as creative tools? I analyzed the uses of this technology with the goal of determining how adjustments to the neural networkâ€™s parameters could affect visual output. I conducted experiments using a reference implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network, documented the results, and suggested a graphical user interface to make the technology more accessible to artists."
